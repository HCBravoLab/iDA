\title{Find embedding space using iterative LDA}
\usage{
iDA(
  data.use,
  mean.low.cutoff = 0.1,
  mean.high.cutoff = 8,
  dispersion.cutoff = 1,
  k.param = 10,
  prune.SNN = 1/15,
  dims.use = 10,
  diag = FALSE,
  set.seed = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.use}{(data.frame) A dataframe of scaled data to find embedding for. (sample x feature)}

\item{mean.low.cutoff}{(numeric) Bottom cutoff on mean for identifying variable genes, passed to function [`VariableGenes`]}

\item{mean.high.cutoff}{(numeric) Top cutoff on mean for identifying variable genes (passed to [`VariableGenes`])}

\item{dispersion.cutoff}{(numeric) Bottom cutoff on dispersion for identifying variable genes (passed to [`VariableGenes`])}

\item{k.param}{(numeric) Defines k for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (passed to [`getSNN`])}

\item{prune.SNN}{(numeric) Sets the cutoff for acceptable Jaccard index when
computing the neighborhood overlap for the SNN construction. Any edges with
values less than or equal to this will be set to 0 and removed from the SNN
graph. Essentially sets the strigency of pruning (0 --- no pruning, 1 ---
prune everything). Passed to [`getSNN`]}

\item{dims.use}{(numeric) A vector of the dimensions to use in construction of the SNN
graph (e.g. To use the first 10 PCs, pass 1:10) (passed to [`getSNN`])}

\item{diag}{Diagonalize the within class scatter matrix (assume the features are independent
within each cluster)}

\item{set.seed}{(numeric or FALSE) seed random number generator before building KNN graph. (passed to [`getSNN`])}
}
\value{
n number of dataframes for each cluster's data
}
\description{
Takes scaled data and iterates between clustering using the Louvain community detection method and embedding in LDA space, then recluster in
 the LDA transformed data space.
